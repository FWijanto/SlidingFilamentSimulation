# SlidingFilamentSimulation
Monte Carlo Simulation of two rigid sliding filaments.
Filaments are connected by stochastic spring-like cross-bridges.
The framework for describing the kinetics of the system is a Kramers fluctuation model.

Notes
--------
This code is written in Mathematica and exported from Mathematica Notebooks. For optimal conditions, view the code in a Mathematica notebook.

Current Situation
-----------
New functionalities are being added to allow binding to neighbours other than the nearest binding site.
Currently, these functionalities have been added for the **main loop** only. Initialisation variables and functions are also updated along the way.
The correctness of these features need to be tested.
All other features are at the previous version which allow only binding on the nearest site.
